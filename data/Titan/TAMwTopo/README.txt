6-Hourly Winds interpolated to 10-m level from surface

64 points per Titan day

Starts in northern autumnal equinox.


lon = longitude 
lat = latitude
ucomp = zonal component of wind (positive values = Eastward wind)
vcomp = meridinonal component of wind (positive values = Northward wind)
time = time (every 6 hours)

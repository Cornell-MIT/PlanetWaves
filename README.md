To erase old logs (Ubuntu 22.04):
> python -c 'import makeWaves; makeWaves.remove_old_logs()'

## MATLAB
Model in makeWaves.m

Model specifics in test_runs.m

## Python (in progress)
To work in virtual enviroment (miniconda)
> conda env create -f environment.yml

> conda activate wave_env

> conda env update --prefix ./env --file environment.yml  --prune

## Model Run Benchmarking

### Changing model geometry

1. Compare effect of changing cut off frequency
2. Compare to wind tank experiments (Banfield et al. 2015)
3. Comparing to closed lakes
   - ID periods of low variation in wind speed, direction, and gusts for (<ins>find_quiet_GREATLAKES.m</ins>)
     - Lake Erie
       1. Deep water buoy
       2. Shallow water buoy
     - Lake Superior 
       1. Deep water buoy (IN PROGRESS)
       2. Shallow water buoy
   - Compare to model for
     - Deep uniform bathymetry
     - Realistic lake bathymetry
4. Comparing to open ocean
   - ID periods of low variation in wind speed, direction, and gusts near Hawaiâ€™i (Huppert et al. 2020)
     - Compare to model for deep uniform bathymetry
     -

## Changes to model

1. Add Alves-Banner-Young curve to model.
2. Add maturity threshold with minimum number of time steps
3. Set batch jobs to make model run in background with updates

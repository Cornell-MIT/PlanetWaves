# PLANETWAVES is a four dimensional spectral wave model adapted from the University of Miami wave model ([UMWM](https://github.com/umwm/umwm)) to produce surface waves for a given bathymetry and a given wind climate on different planets. The model has been validated using buoy data at the Great Lakes.

## To do
```
(1) Add shallow buoy for Lake Superior
(2) Add shallow and deep buoy for Lake Erie(?)
(3) Finish comparison with Banfield+2015 for changing environmental conditions
(4) Run for Titan lakes
```
